the bare enunciation ol our dogma beside the words which he used in
delivering it. “This is my body ’'‚ says our Lord; “ I believe it to be
thy body ”, replies the Catholic. “This is my blood ¹³, repeats our
Redeemer; “I believe it to be the figure oi thy blood ’'‚ rejoins the
Protestant. Whose speech is here yea, yeat who saith amen ιο the

suspetflus, Lessing, (Berengarius of Tours, complete works, ed. Lacl-
mann, voI. v111. p. 814): “ 1t it be true, as Zwinglius assensus
the dotlrine ot merely extemal signs was the primitive and oopus]
dotlriue of the Church, how was it possible that it should suddenly
have given rise ιο tlte dotflrine ol transsubstantiation? Would not this
have been a dangerous leap in the dark, such as the human reason

never takes, even in its most unaccountable wanderings Irom the truth?
And in order to avoid taking it, should we not in our own case have
approached the dotlrine of transsubstantiation by amore consistenuii
less direti course? ShouId we not have gone on Irorn merely externat

signs to pregnant signs, as we will call them lor the sake ol brevity‚or

to such as are full oi meaning and hidden virtue? And havingassumed
this much,we should then have passed from signs to reality. The process
would then be this ε first came the heliel in naeretv externat signa· next
the belief in signs possessing a virtue ς and finally, a substituting Ior
any sIgn whatever the reality or the ¹thing itseli. Now the question
arises, how did it come about that the transition was ntade Imm the
first to the second stage without excitIng comment or being the occasIon
oI a controversy, while the transitIon irotn the second to the first, =
effetied, as we are told, by Paschasius, was the occasion oi much
trouble and quarrelling? This is the more remarkable, sincethe Iornter
would have been more offensive than the latter ιο the saith and religious l
IeeIiugs ol the people. Now, as it is absolutely certain that the first l
Ieap in this supposed course oi intelletlual gymnastics w‘as not the l
occasion oI either protest or controversy, it is but natural to inter that
no such course ever took pIace at all, and that the doflrine ot the
Church was from the beginning what it is to day '’. .

N. 60. Eos qui dicunt transsubstantiationem esse creditu impossiti· I
lem sic redarguit Card. Newman (Apologia, part. Vll) : “ People say· i
that the dotlrine os transsubstantiation is difficult to believe... It
is difficolt, impossible ιο imagine, 1 grant —hut how is it difficult to
believei... For mysell, I cannot indeed prove it, I cannot tell I
horo it is; but I say, Why should not it be? What²s to hinder it?
What do I know ot substance or matter? Just as much as the
greatest philosophers, and that is nothing at aII; so much is this the
case, that there isa rising school of philosophy now, which considers
