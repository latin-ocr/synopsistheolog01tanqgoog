Exustam Ex ANGLICIS AUCTQRIBUS. 1³·

spiritual death... When one considers how much sin is due to ignorance
not fully culpable‚ to sudden gasts of passion which diminish the power
ol reason, to athual inadvertence os the grievousness ol a given adl, and
ιο the dimly appreciated connedtion ol adl with aet - and when one
takes into account those turnings ol the hean'to God, which cume at
some period or other to most ol those, sinners as they may be, who
have known God in their youth, we see at once that it is unnecessary ιο
go ιο extreme lengths in condemning the multitudes to Hell ”. (Dublr'n
Rean'c'w jan. 1881, p. 133).

Ν. zo Quo melius concrpr' possit quomodo ignis instrui realis sit,
haec animadvertit Murtinet .· “No violent passion is ever enkindled in
the suul, that the flames ol it do not communicate without. Despair
above all others, presente the symptoms ol a true confragration. The
eyes flash; the blood, bolling in the veins, spreads lire to the extremiora,
and it it is not carried off, the organization is dissolved in the midst ol
a devouring lever. Let us imagine now in the superior faculties of man
the lire ol despair, as intense at it will be in the condemned, when he
contemplates, by necessity, the immensity ol his missortune in the ¹
greatness and beauty of the God whom he has lost. Let us suppose
also in his material organization, that tenacity which divine power will
give to the resuscitated body, and which will enable it ιο suffer all the
anguish ol death without dying, and we can imagine, without difficulty
that the condemned soul, united ιο the body, will carry into it all the
elements ol an eternal conflagration ”. (Martinet, Religion in Society,
New·York, 1850, vol. 1, p. 9091.)

N. 36. Quoddam Purgatorr'i genus hodrkrm' protestantes nonnulli
adrm'ttnnt. Farrar ipse (Et. Hope, p. XVll) scribit: '⁴ ll indeed that
doctrine consisted in nothing else but these words from the Catechism
os the C. ol Trent... and is the term “ lire ” may be interpreted imma·
terially, as the Eastern Church and Western theologians of all ages
have decided that it may, then there would be nothing in the doflrine
ol Purgatory which seems to me in any way inconsistent with Scriptum,

while it certainly is consistent with a very ancient belief ol the¹ Church,
and with the all but universal usage uf prayers lor the dead ²’. Nec

aliter C. Butler: “ Do not all who call themselves ratrhnal Protestants
think with us that, tonse the language of Dr Johnson, the generality
ol mankind are neither so obstinately wicked as to deserve everlasting
punishment, nor so good as to merit being admitted into the society
of the blessed spirits; and that God is therefore graciously pleased to
allow a middle state, where they may be purified by a certain degree
ol suffering''· (Chartes ltutler, apud Oxenlr. Catholic Eschatology,

an 40·)
