with holy Matrimony. ln the case of that sacred rite we are happily
able to point to the authorized use oi the title; it is spoken ol as “a
sacrament which knitteth man and wile in perpetual love '¹ (Boolrol
Homilies). Holy Matrimony is “an honorable estate, instituted oi
God in the time os man’s innocency, signifyn'ng unto us the mystical
union between Christ and His Church‚ which holy estate Christ l
adorned and beautified with llis presence and first miracle that lle
wrought in Cana os Galilee”. How appropriately‚ how rightly, it is
called among us the “ Sacrament of Matrimony” l (Morgan Dt'r, sacra·
mental System, p. 87-88).

N· 54. Nonnulli Protestantes ret‘le intelligunt nil deduci posse tr
Matr. XIX, 9, contra nrammonii indissolubilitotem· ita v. g. E. J. Phelps ἐ
(Forum, Dec. 1889, p. 3 59) : “The advocates oi the theory oi divorce l

the precept oi Christ as given in S. Matthew’s Gospel, and upon the
idea that some moralists entertain ol the peculiar heinousness oi that
offense against the marriage relation; as compared with any other. ln
the text of St Matthew‚ Christ is reported to have said ε “’ Whosoever
shall put away his wife, save forjurationem and shall marry another, κ
committeth adultery’'. But in the Gospels ol St Marc and St Lukethe
words here italicized are omitted, and the language as there given isa
distindl condemnation ol the putting away a wile lor any cause what
ever, and tiranys'nganother. By what authority,intelligibletoalayman
is the statement os St Matthew accepted aud that oi St Mark and
St Luke rejedledi Both cannot he right. ls it more likely that the two
are mistalren than the one ? ”

· Ν. 59- Plerumque titulier plusquam vir divortiiincommoda patitur : ἵ
“Woman is more than man the victim oi the degradation which ;
divorce entails. Men can withdraw lrom conjugal society with all the
advantages of his strength and his authority in order to enter upon ³
new ties ; woman cannot withdraw lrom it with all her dignity. She
leaves behind her best possessions‚ her maiden beauty and the channs
oi her youth, and only regains with difficulty the money she has
brought. Who shnll seelr this withered plant, whose freshness is
gone, and who is cast out from the family she has born, when she can
no longer hope to found another?'’ (diensem, Marriage transl. by
