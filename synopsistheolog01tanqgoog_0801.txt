De Ordine.

N· 3· C alor'm‘stoe et Liberatus teneat omnes fideles esse sacerdotes, ut
videre est apud W. Lyon, A study ol the setis, p. 47 : “All Calvinistic
Protestants and their descendants hold that all believers are priests
alilre, and receive grace direilly from God, not through sacerdotal
agency. Their ministers are chosen by the congregations, though
under certain restriilions where a power is recognized above the
Congregation,flas by the Presbyterians, 3ηά differ from their brethren
only officially and by natural gists or special education ''.

teachers, yet the ordination to the priestly office appears even in the “
Apostolic Church as an appointment of the Spirit. ln the Lutheran

Chut'ch preachers are ordained according to the apostolic method by
laying on ol the hands ot the brethren - an emblem of the bestowment

footing with the sacraments properly so called, 3ηά we cannot suppose
that extraordinary gilts are connetled tberewith, as they were in the
apostles’ time '’. (Martensra, Christian Dogmatics, ἓ 272).

“ Orders, or ordination, may be defined as a sacred rite or Sacrament
oi the New Law, instituted by' Christ, by which spiritual power is
conferred ior efferting and administering the Sacraments, and grace
given rightly to perform other ecclesiastical funilions. That it isa
sacrament has been disputed by some, but without sufficient reason,
since it was evidently instituted by Christ himself, with outward signs,
and does confer grace ''. (Α . Mortimer: Catholic Faith and Pratlice,
vol. 11, New York, 1898, p. 79).
