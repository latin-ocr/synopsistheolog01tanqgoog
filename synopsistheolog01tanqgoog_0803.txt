the bonds oi duty, in making it promise eternal fidelhy, the family does
not adl in contradiilion to the nature oi love, but obeys rather its own
nature. Eternity so truly enters into the nature oi love, that iove would
not venture to ask anything or to give anything without promising
eternity. lts first aiis are always oaths oi fidelity without end, and
even when it praetises deception, it is obliged to use reigned words, or
it would obtain nothing... lt is urged that the heart has rights, and
that the wows ol eternity are impossible. 1 acknowledge that love has
rights for the sonning oi the conjugal union, but it has none at all ior
dissolving it. To the principle of the heart’s liberty, we must oppose
that oi the heart's fidelity; and herein we assign to it an office more
beautiful, and a glory more pure, than il we claimed ior it the privilege
of givingitseli up to chance, and of changing its objeii without ceasing...
l confess that to require oi the beart an attachment which cannot be
given up, demands grave reasons. l discern two such, which appear
ro me irrefutable: the dignity oi the wile, and the interest oi the
children ''.

Dt'vortt'um leves discordias auget ac aidullerr'o fovet: “How many
irivolous quarrels and disgusts are there, which people oi common
prudence endeavour to forget when they lie under the necessity oi ·
passing their lives together, but which would be soon inflamed into the
most deadly hatred, were they pursued to the utmost‚under the prospeil
ol an easy separation. We must consider that nothing is more dan·
gerous than to unite two persons so closely in all their interests and
concerns as husband and wife, without rendering the union entire and
total. The least possibility oia separate interest must be the source
oi endless quarrels and suspicions. The wife, not secure ol her esta·
blishment‚ will still be driving some separate end or projeii, and the
husband's selfishness, being accompanied with more power, may be
still more dangerous '’. (Home, Essay XIX.)

“lt is notorious that the desire to be rid ol a relation that has
ceased to be pleasant, leads many a man, and not a lew women, to
conduil either intended to bring about that result,¹ or recklessly entered
upon in the leeling that il it take place, it will not be unwelcome.
Chancelor Kent observed that, in atiing judicially in a large number oi
divorce cases, he had reason to believe that adultery was sometimes
committed by the husband lor the very purpose of the divorce. The
history ol the subjeii in other countries goes to prove that immorality
increases as facilities sor divorce are enlarged. They are a stimulus
to it, not a preventive ’'. (E. Phelps, Forum, Dec. 1889, p. 363).

N. 61. [livortr'um bono educationi prolis nocet: ‘⁵ There must be
two persons to cause the dawn oi lile, two to guide it to its complete
development. A father alone is authority too severe, reason too cold,
strength too weighty; a mother all alone is love without restraint,
gentleness without guidance, tender'ness without coneilion. Both are
needful for education. Nature has joined and mingled them together
