sinners... be made righteous, not by imputatlon merely, any more than
in the other case, but shall be made really and actually righteous, as
completely so as the others were made really and adlually sinuers.
When we say that man has no righteousness oshis own, we speak ol t

him as our os Chn'st: but r'n Christ, and united to him, he is made
nghteous, not by a fiction, or imputatiorr only ol Christ's righteousness,
hut by a real and living spiritual union with a righteous Head asa

Rigtheousness ol that Head ''.

N · 134 Deus, declarando nos justos esse, eo r'pto nos justos facit, ut
diserte ostendit J. H. Nervman (op. cit. p. 78): “Strange it is, but
such is the opinion ol one ol the two schools ol divinity which have all
along been mentioned, that God’s calling us righteous implies, not only
that we have not been, but that we shall never be, righreous, Surely lt
is a strange paradox to say that a thing is not because He says it is;
that the solemn averment ol the living and true God is inconsistent with
the fact averred ; this His accepting our obedience is a bar to His mak-
ing it acceptable, and that the glory ol llis pronouncing us righteous
lies in His leaving us uurighteous''.

glow οἱ lire penetrales the irou. Grace communicates a new quality
to the soul, by which it is transformed into the image ol God. This

ol this bud, and brings lorth its blossom aud lruit, so our soul is in the
highest manner cnuobled by the communication ol God's grace, which
is called in Holy Writ the seed ol God, aud filled with the power ol
God, it assumes a divine nature ’'.

Our Lord there says, “When ye shall have done all those things which Ι

merit olgood works, and teach that salvation is entirely gratuitous,
