De Gratih.

Ν. 33. [inbecillitatem hortinis lapsi ad bonum naturale laciendum
ita limitant hodierni Caluriu'rtae .· ‘⁸ lt is admitted in all the consessions
above quoted that man, since the sall has not only the liberty of choice
or power ol sels-determination, but also is able to perform moral adis,
good as well as evil. He can be kind and just, and sulfil his social
duties in a manner to secure the approbation oi his sellowmen. lt is
not meant that the state of mind in which these 'atis are performed,¹
or the motives by which they are detennined, are such as to meet the ’
approbation ol an infinitely holy God; but simply that these atis, as
to the matter of them, are prescribed by the moral law ’'. (Hordge,
Systematic Theology, vol. ll, p. 263.)

N· 49· Unihrrii negant necessilatem grulr'oe adjustrficatr'onem‚ quia
haec est solum naturalis conversio ad Deum: “By repentance we do
not mean sorrow or contrition, hut simply turning round whenever we
are going wrong, and beginning at once to go right This is something
in every man’s power, and this makes him a Christian '¹. (J. Clarke,
Orthod. p. 185).

N. 62 Difficultatem perseverantie, etiam in minimis, praeclare
Newman variis comparationibus illustrat : “This is what we find to be
the case, not only in matters of religion, but os this world, viz., that,
let a person do a thing ever so well, the chance is that he will no't be
able to do it a number ol times running without mistake. Let a person
be ever so good an accountant, he will add up a sum wrongly now and
then, though you could not guess belorehand when or why he was to
fail... So it is with our religious dnties; we may be able to keep from
every sin in particular as the particular temptation comes, but this
does not hinder its being certain that we shall not in lact keep from all
sins, though that “ all ’² is made up ot those particular sins ²' etc.; totus
locus legendus est (Discourses to Mixed Congreg. dis. Vll, Persever-
ance in Grace).

N. 93 C alvim'stae etiam hodierni tenent bominem liberum non esre
rub influxu gran'ae: ‘⁴ lt will ol' course he admitted that, il efficacious
grace is the exercise oi almighty power, it is irresistible” (Hodge,

Svrvorsrs ΙΙΙ. - 49
