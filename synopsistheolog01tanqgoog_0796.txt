De sacramentis in genere.

N. ad Convent'enliam septem sacramentorum sic poetice describit
Goerhe (AutoBiography, Bohn’s translat. vol. 1, p. 245-248): ‘⁴ Herea
youthful pair give their hands to one another... the priest prouounces
his blessing upon them, and the bond is indissoluble. lt is not long
before this wedded pair bring a lilreness to the threshold of the altar ; i
it is purified with holy water, and so incorporated into the church that
it cannot forfeit this benefit but through the most monstrous apostasy.

ι The child in the course of life pradlices himself in earthly things of his
own accord, in heavenly things he must be instrudled. Does it prove,

on examination, that this has been fully done, he is now received into
the bosom of the church as an aflual citizen, as a true and voluntary
