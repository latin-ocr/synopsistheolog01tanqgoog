gant :,“ This is especially evident in that most important era ol human
lile, conversion. Therein we see how grace differs from mere power,
how it does not work irresistibly and by force, but has regard to human
freedom, gives it a power ol choice, ol deciding, an alternative ol
either -· or gralia trahit, non cogit. lt is immanent grace, in the
yielding heart ol' man, which constrains free will to surrender itsell to ’
the grace which seeks an entrance, which enables it to open to its
influence, like the flower which opens to the sunbeam; yet itis the
internal power ol the natural will which bears witness that the natural
will is not a mere name but a reality, and that it can close the heart
against the operations οἰ grace, and shut itself up in a sels-choses
darkness ”. (Martensen, Christian Dogmatics, Edinburg,1898,§204.

N. 116. De sufficienlrii fidei ad justficalr'onem scribit anglicanus
Faber(Primitive dotlr. ofjustific. XlX): “The Church of England,
and all tlte other relormed Churches, make the procuring cause oijus·
tification to be the extrinsicvrighteousness ol Christ apprehended and
appropriated by the instrumental hand ol saith ”. Cf. Newmatrs tal.
on Justific. leci, 1„ Hodierni lutherani ita mentem suam exponunt
“The evangelical principle that saith alone justifies rests upon the pre·
supposition that Christ alone justifies. lt is only in virtue ol the
righteousness oi Christ, in virtue of the new fundamental relationship
with Christ, that marr can be reconciled to his God; and by saith
alone, as the profoundest acl of susceptibility and subjedliveness on
the part of the inner man os the lreart, can Christ be appropriated; by
saith alone can man obtain blessedness in its indissoluble complete·
ness'’. Attamen haec fides bono opera suo tenrpore producit: “Justi·
sying saith cannot possibly exist in the sool in n dead or merely
stationary condition, but that, like the living fruit-bearing seed com. r
it contains within itself a mighty germinating power which must y
necessarily beget a lroly development ol lile''. (illartensen, op. cit. l

N. 127. De trotarii justificationis recenter scribebat calvinista: i
“Justilication isa robe which hides, or as the Bible expresses it, covers
from the eye of justice the sins ol the believer. They are sins, they
deserve the wratli and curse ol God, but the necessity for the inflitlion
ol that curse no longer exists’' (Hodgr, Syst. theol. vol. 111, p. 1633- ,
“ justification is a judicial or lorensic acl, i. e. an adl os God as judge
proceeding according to law, declaring that the sinner is just, i. e. that ¹
the law no longer condemns him, but acquits and pronounces him to be
entitled to eternal lite... The righteousness of Christ is in justification
imputecl to the believer, that is set to his account '³ (Hodge, l. cit. l
118·119).
