phenomena to constitute the whole of our knowledge in physics. The
catholic doflrine leaves phenomena alone. lt does not say that the
phenomena go3 on the contrary, it says that they remain; nor does it
say that the same phenomena are in several places ot once. lt deals
with what no one on earth knows anything about, the material
substances themselves ”.

Ν. 157. Verbum minchah de vens sacrificiis praedicari sic exponit
protestans audior, A. Cave (The Scripture doflrine of sacrifice, 1877,
p. 479) : ‘⁶ Minchalt, from a root inonach, to give, is used in a variety
of senses, each however being perfeClly clear from the context, and
having the same fundamental idea. lt is sometimes employed to
designate the meai or meat-‹ffiring of Leviticus3 sometimes it has a
slightly wider significance, and stands for bloodless as opposed to blood
sacrifices, e. g. l's. XL, 7; Isa. XIX, 21 ; Dan. lx, 27. Occasionally
a blood sacrifice, such as the momiog or evening offering of a lamb, is
intended, e. g. 1 Kr'ngs, xv111, ²9³ 2 Kirags, 111, 20 ; Ps. CXII, 23
Dan. lX, 21 ''.

N· 15ss Ultimum Cernantfur'sse sacrificium ita probat idem prote·
stansfiuc'tor: “That the Lord’s supper was intended by its Founder
to be understood as in some way connefied with the ancient sacrifices
may be inferred from the following particulars: first, the time of its
institution; second, the symbols selefled; and third, the words
addressed to the communicants... The Lord's supper was in some
sense a sacrifice that is to say, it had some manifest conneflion with
the sacrificial injunstions propounded by Moses... The sacrifice of the
Lord's supper was thus a sacrifice allied to the Paschal sacrifice, but
memorializing the atonementwrought by the death of Jesus ”. (A. Cave,
op. cit. 432-439).

N.159· Missam α Patribus ut sacraficium habitum fuisse candide
fatentur eruditi Protestantes: “The Lord's supper was universally
regarded not only as a sacrament, but also as a sacrifice, the true and
eternal sacrifice of the new covenant, superseding all the provisional
and typical sacrifices of the old : taking the place particularly of the
passover‚ or thefeast of the typical redemption from Egypt ’'. (P. Scltaff,
History of the Christian Choreb, Vol. ΙΙ, 1892, p. 245). ·

De Poenitenttae sacramento.

N. (η. Anglicani, praesertim Ritualistae, confessionem ut utilem, sed ’
non ut necessariam agnoscunt ; “ ln the Anglican Church Absolution
- for we baveno Sacrament of Penance in the Roman sense of the
word — is a simple privilege of the faithful. To make confession
privately to a priest is not matter ofobligation ; it is not a general duty;
it is not enforced3 it is not recommended for general vuse ; its pracii'ce
gives no right to self·laudation on the ground of a higher status in duty
to the Choreb, nor may they who decline to do so be justly charged
