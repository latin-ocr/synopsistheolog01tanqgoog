the Baptist (Mau. ΙΙΙ, 11), the statement of Christ himself as to the
relation of the same to the kingdom (Manxtu), and with the apostolic
ideas that Christ gave a new spirit to mankind, that it dwells in his
Church, and that the object of baptism is the reception into the com.
munion of this spirit ” (SchaffHernog Eucyclopaedia‚ p. 200).

R. Barclay, Theologiae verae Christianae Apologia: “As there isone
Lord and one saith, so there is one Baptism; which is not the putting
away the lilth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience before
God, by tho resurrefiion of J.-C. And this baptism is a pure and
spiritual thing, to wit : the baptism of the Spirit and Fire, by which we
are buried with him, that being washed and purged from our sins, we
may walk in newness of life: of which the Baptism of John wasa
figure, which was commanded for a time, and not to continue for ever ”
(op. cit. prop. XII).

N· 17· Contra Baptr'slns, qui contendunt vocem Βαπτίζω nihil aliud
, significare posse nisi immersionem, haec subjicimus ex opere Greek and
englislr Lexr'con of tlte N. T. by E. Robinson, New-York‚ 1850,
p. 118·119 : “While in Greek writers, as above exhibited, from Plato
onwards, ΒαπτΙζω is everywhere to rt'nk, fo immense, to onemhaim,
either wholly orparn·ally; yet in hellenistic usage, and especially in
reference to the rite of baptism, it would seem to have expressed not
always simply immerst'on, but the more general idea of ablutr'on or
affienbn. This appears from the following consideratione: a) The
circumstances narrated Luke rr, 38, compared with those in Mark 7,
2-4 where νίπτω is employed, implying according to oriental custom a
pouring of water on the hands... b) ln Acts 2, 41 three thousand per-
sons are said to have been baptized atJerusalem apparently in one day
at the season of Pentecost in June ; and in Acts 4, 4 the same rite is
necessarily implied in respefi to five thousand more. Against the idea
of full immersion in these cases there lies a difficulty, apparently insu·
perable, in the scarcity of water. There is in summer no running
stream in the vicinity of Jemsalem, except the mere rill of Siloam a
few rods in length ; and the city is and was supplied with water from irs
cisterns and public reservoirs. From neither ol these sources could a
supply habe been well obtained for the immersion of eight thousand
persons ''. Cfr. Robinson, Biblical Researches in Palestine, ra ed.

the body and blood of Jesus Christ are truly and really present in the

Omnipotent‚ said, “This is my body, this is my blood ”. Here is our
argument, and what can we advance, to prove a strici accordante
