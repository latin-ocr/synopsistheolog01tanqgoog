N. 70. Profestontes consessionis originem sic bodie explicare conan-
tur: “ Private confession originated in the monastery, where only nans-
gressions of the rules of the order were subject ιο public confession
and penance. According to its idea, monastic life presupposes all sin
impossible hut sin in thought, and this was to be confessed privately
to the Abbot... Outside the monastery, private confession at first met
with opposition from the side of the clergy. The Bishops of Apulia
and Campania demanded that sins confessed in private should be
ntade publicly known to the congregation; and· it was this demand
which first caused Leo the Great to officially recognize and confirm
private confession as a legal institution. ln the eighth and nintb cen· i

N. 72· Confesstom's sacramentalis utilitatem agnovit anglicanus
H. P. Lindon .· “Christ Choreb, Oxsord, March, 1883. M y deor - :

Ι have myself used confession wheneverl have needed it ever sinoe 1847.
and have never regretted it. l think it braces tlre soul as nothi} else

application of the absolving power left by Our Lord to his Cburclt
than the more general formulae of the Daily and Communion Services.
l bave felt too, as regards my oivn case, that Bishop Butler’s general
doflrine about the safer course in questions of condufl points distinclly
to the praflise... Notwithstanding the finiteness and imperfeclions
of the earthly minister, and the omniscience and tendemess of our
great High Priest in heaven, the former does, by Christ’s commission·

made so easily when we are alone ''. ¹

N. 121. Quo sensu tora solvi rubeat pro absolutione α censens i
egregie exponit J. H. rk'eoonmn (The Present position of Catholics in l
England, 1889, p. 112-113): ‘⁵ l repeat, the Catltolic who perpetrares ι
any great and public sin offends his hlaker, and oflends his ecclesiasticul ι
society ; the injury against his Maker is punished by an ipso soant
separation from His favour, the injury against Society when itis

¹ Repentance is required on the part of the offender for both restorations: ’

the only real pardum no money is, or ever can be paid. The Sacra-
ment cannot be bought: such an acl would be a horrible crime..

“ Neither for sins committed, nor sins to come, has money ever been
taken as an equivalent for one no more than for the other. On the
other hand it is quite true that the injury done to the Choreb, when it
happens to be visited with a censure t which is not a common case). bas
